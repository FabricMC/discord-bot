The exact meaning is as follows:```
   a b: a and b have to be supplied in this order
   a|b: either a or b can be supplied, lowest precedence (a b|c is the same as (a b)|c)
   [a]: a is optional
  a...: a may be repeated, at least one instance, highest precedence
 (a b): a and b act as a common element in the surrounding context
     x: literal input \"x\" required
   <x>: x is a variable capturing any input token
<x...>: x is a multi-word variable capturing at least one input token
   --x: position independent flag x
 --x=a: position independent flag x with mandatory value a (value may still be empty if a is e.g. (|b) or [b])
 --x[=a]: position independent flag x, optionally with value a
